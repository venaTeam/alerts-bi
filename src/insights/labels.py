"""Plain-language names for findings, for pages that never show a rule id.

The reader portal names a problem, never its catalogue id (product owner, 2026-10-04): a
reader sees "No rule link", not "R4". Every label here is short on purpose; the longer
explanations stay in :mod:`src.portal.explain`.

Pure text, no markup: the page layer escapes it.
